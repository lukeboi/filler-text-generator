# 2020 Update: This project was a random idea I worked on for a while. Haven't touched it in years.

A simple javascript filler text generation libary. Supports both Lorem Ipsum (aka Lipsum) as well as random english words.

Example usage:
```
var filler = require("filler-text-generator");
console.log(filler.generate(3, "s"));
-> Admodum ingeniis volunt suspicor, fore. Etsi desiderent remissius suspicor avocent, quamquam modus perveniri litteras sive. Varias novum.
```
